title:  Writing good content
---

The success or failure of the website, in terms of getting people to understand what LCC need them to, will depend on writing good content for the website.

Some of the key principles of writing good content are:

1. Keep it short, simple and to the point.
** Shorter words and sentences are easier to understand. Avoid large chunks of unbroken text. Break content down into its briefest amount. A usability study by Nielsen shows that usability can be improved by 58% just by cutting half of the words on a webpage [Nielsen, 1997; How Users Read on the Web](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/).
2. Put the point of the article at the beginning.
** Eye-tracking studies have shown that users read in chunks and tend to lose focus as they read down the page [Nielsen, 2006; F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/).
** People often want to get a fact or a piece of information, make this easy to scan for.
3. Don’t assume any previous knowledge.  
** Explain clearly the item so that it make sense to a reader with little or no background information. This may be the first page they see.
4. Be consistent, not uniform.
** Use the same language and design patterns throughout. Every page can be unique, but use the same conventions for where things like “further reading” and “related information” etc. are placed.
