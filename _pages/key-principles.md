The key principles for a good user experience on a website are:

* Informative
  * The website should provide the information that users expect to find, and to provide this information in such a way as to be accessible, clear, and easy to find.
- Fast
  - The website should be fast to load and should help users find information quickly.
- Consistent
  - The website should have consistent navigation, language, layout and visual styling
- Appropriate
  - The website should have an appropriate tone, style, language, and visual design for its intended audience(s)
- Providing feedback
  - The website should provide feedback to the user, informing them about the system status, any needed actions from the user's part, and provide help.

Most of these principles can be achieved by from writing good content, retaining a logical, shallow navigation system, and by applying the templates in a consistent manner.
