The site will be navigated in two ways â€“ search and browse.

## Search
Search will automatically index all pages on the site. There are still some elements that are important to bear in mind when writing content to ensure that it appears in search appropriately.

These considerations are:

* Write short, informative titles that make sense when viewed out of context of the page itself. Avoid having multiple items with near identical titles that when they will appear as search results might be difficult to differentiate. [Nielsen, 2009; World's Best Headlines: BBC News](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/worlds-best-headlines-bbc-news/)
* Attach a full set of metadata to every item. Ensure that all the metadata fields are completed at the time of content creation, as these are the mechanisms that the search tool uses in order to return results.

## Browse
When users browse the site they will not always start at the home page, but they will navigate down from a place where the user has landed. For this reason, each section should allow the user to understand where they are in the wider context of the site.

The navigation system is topic based, with key tasks appearing within a topic section. It is important to keep a balance between depth and breadth of navigation [Morville & Rosenfeld, 2006; Information Architecture for the World Wide Web](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527341.do). Try to keep to the following rule of thumb:

* Each section should be no more than 4 levels deep
* Each level should contain no more than 12 items
* Items within each level should be grouped so that similar things are located next to each other
